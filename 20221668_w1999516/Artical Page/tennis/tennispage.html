From its humble beginnings as a medieval pastime to the dazzling spectacle of modern Grand Slam tournaments, tennis has evolved into a globally cherished sport. This essay explores the history, rules, benefits, and profound impact of tennis on individuals and society, celebrating its enduring legacy as one of the world's most beloved and respected games.Tennis is known for its different playing surfaces, such as grass, clay, and hard courts, each offering distinct challenges and influencing players' playing styles. The variety in court surfaces adds an exciting dimension to the sport and showcases the adaptability and versatility of tennis professionals.</p>
        <p class="para">The origins of tennis can be traced back to the medieval era, where it was played as an indoor game called "jeu de paume" (game of the palm) in France. Over time, the sport evolved, and rackets were introduced, leading to the name "real tennis." Real tennis gained popularity among nobility and was played in grand courts throughout Europe.
                        In the 19th century, a version of tennis we recognize today began to take shape. It was known by various names such as lawn tennis or simply tennis. Major contributors to the modernization of tennis were Harry Gem and Augurio Perera, who standardized the rules and introduced the use of a net. The All England Croquet Club (now known as the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club) in Wimbledon hosted the first Wimbledon Championships in 1877, becoming the world's oldest tennis tournament.

        <p class="para">Tennis is played on a rectangular court with a net in the middle, dividing the court into two equal halves. The objective of the game is to hit the ball over the net and into the opponent's side of the court in such a way that the opponent cannot return it. Points are scored when the opponent fails to return the ball successfully.

            A typical tennis match is played in a best-of-three or best-of-five sets format. To win a set, a player must win at least six games, with a two-game advantage. If the set is tied at 6-6, a tiebreak game is played. The player who wins seven points with a two-point advantage takes the set. The player who wins the majority of sets is declared the winner of the match.
